    *   \brief Interrupt Status 1 register.
    *
    *   Whenever an interrupt is triggered, the MAX30101 pulls the active-low
    *   interrupt pin into its low state until the interrupt is cleared. This
    *   register contains the status of the interrupts.
    *
    *   The register is structured as follows:

    *   **A_FULL: FIFO Almost Full Flag**
    *
    *   In SpO2 and HR modes, this interrupt triggers when the FIFO write pointer 
    *   has a certain number of free spaces remaining. The trigger number can be set by the 
    *   #MAX30101_FIFO_CONF register. The interrupt is cleared by reading the #MAX30101_INT_ST_1 register.
    *
    *   **PPG_RDY: New FIFO Data Ready**
    *
    *   In SpO2 and HR modes, this interrupt triggers when there is a new sample in the data FIFO. 
    *   The interrupt is cleared by reading the #MAX30101_INT_ST_1, or by reading the #MAX30101_FIFO_DATA register.
    *
    *   **ALC_OVF: Ambient Light Cancellation Overflow**
    *
    *   This interrupt triggers when the ambient light cancellation function 
    *   of the SpO2/HR photodiode has reached its maximum limit,
    *   and therefore, ambient light is affecting the output of the ADC.
    *   The interrupt is cleared by reading the #MAX30101_INT_ST_1.
    *
    *   **PWR_RDY: Power Ready Flag**
    *
    *   On power-up or after a brownout condition, when the supply voltage VDD transitions
    *   from below the undervoltage lockout (UVLO) voltage to above the UVLO voltage, a 
    *   power-ready interrupt is triggered to signal that the module is powered-up and ready to collect data.

    /**
    *   \brief FIFO data register.
    *
    *   The circular FIFO depth is 32 and can hold up to 32 samples of data.
    *   The sample size depends on the number of LED channels (a.k.a. channels) configured as active. 
    *   As each channel signal is stored as a 3-byte data signal, the FIFO width can be 3 bytes, 6 bytes, 9 bytes, 
    *   or 12 bytes in size. The #MAX30101_FIFO_DATA register in the I2C register map points to the next sample to be read 
    *   from the FIFO. #MAX30101_FIFO_RP points to this sample. Reading #MAX30101_FIFO_DATA register, 
    *   does not automatically increment the I2C register address. Burst reading this register, 
    *   reads the same address over and over.
    *   Each sample is 3 bytes of data per channel (i.e., 3 bytes for RED, 3 bytes for IR, etc.). 
    *   The FIFO registers (0x04–0x07) can all be written and read, but in practice only the #MAX30101_FIFO_RP
    *   register should be written to in operation. The others are automatically incremented or filled with data 
    *   by the MAX30101. When starting a new SpO2 or heart rate conversion, it is recommended to first clear 
    *   the #MAX30101_FIFO_WP, #MAX30101_OVF_CNT, and #MAX30101_FIFO_RP registers to all zeroes (0x00) 
    *   to ensure the FIFO is empty and in a known state. When reading the MAX30101 registers in one
    *   burst-read I2C transaction, the register address pointer typically increments so that the next byte of
    *   data sent is from the next register, etc. The exception to this is the #MAX30101_FIFO_DATA data register,
    *   register 0x07. When reading this register, the address pointer does not increment, but the #MAX30101_FIFO_RP does.
    *   So the next byte of data sent represents the next byte of data available in the FIFO.

    *   In multi-LED mode, each sample is split into up to four time slots,

    *   if SLOT1 and SLOT2 are non-zero, then one sample is 2 x 3 = 6 bytes. 
    *   If SLOT1 through SLOT3 are all non-zero, then one sample is 3 x 3 = 9 bytes.
    *   The slots should be enabled in order (i.e., SLOT1 should not be disabled if SLOT2 
    *   or SLOT3 are enabled). 
    *   Both LED3 and LED4 are wired to Green LED. Green LED sinks current out
